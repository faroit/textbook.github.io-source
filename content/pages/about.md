Title: About

This website is proudly powered by [Pelican][pel], which takes great advantage
of [Python][py].

The theme is a custom job, but it draws heavily from Pelican's base `notmyidea`
theme by [Smashing Magazine][sm]. Another inspiration was [Campo Santo][cs],
whose website I borrowed extensively from (the name, `meadowlark`, is a
reference to their forthcoming game [Firewatch][fw]; it's the state bird of
Wyoming, where the game is set).


The icons in the right-hand link bar are from [Font Awesome][fa] by Dave Gandy.
The pure HTML/CSS "Fork me on GitHub" ribbon is based on
[`github-fork-ribbon-css`][ghfr] by Simon Whitaker; I modified it to be flatter
and use Keith Bates' [Collegiate][col] font.
